        <h1>Researcher Interests</h1>

        <p>I'm a PhD student and researcher in Deep Learning with a focus on NLP and conversational systems. My research line aims to increase the capacity of transformers and large language models(LLM) through external memory and modular architectures.</p>

        <p>In addition to my work in AI, I'm also a software engineer with experience in application development and data science. I have worked on various software projects and collaborated with companies in the tech industry.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about AI research and always on the lookout for new challenges to apply my knowledge and skills in the field. I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me.</p>
